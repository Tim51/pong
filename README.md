# pong

One of the first java program I made. This game was intended as a experimental learning experience rather than a fully polished end product, so parts of code could be unintuitive, unnecessary or inefficient.

# about game
This pong game is played between two players. Keys used: arrowkeys, w, s, spacebar. Start game by running PongGameGUI.

Features and possible improvements:

* 2 Players. Simple AI Could be added (, has probability to start moving toward ball every several milliseconds).
* Simple interface, controlled by keyboard. Could also add mouse controls, this was done in one of my other programs.
* Has a settings menu. Settings are saved into a text file.
* Currently uses hitbox collision system. More accurate collision systems exist (, e.g projecting lines from ball to predict collision).
* Has a keybinding framework. Could be added to settings menu.
* Has weird physics. Physics are easy to update.
* No sound. Adding is similar to adding images.
